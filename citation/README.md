  abstract={Knowledge about the temperature distribution inside solid-state laser crystals is essential for calculation of thermal phase shift, thermal lensing, thermally induced birefringence, and heat-induced crystal bending. Solutions for the temperature distribution for the case of steady-state heat loading have appeared in the literature only for simple cylindrical crystal shapes and are usually based on numerical techniques. For the first time, to our knowledge, a full analytical solution of the heat equation for an anisotropic cubic cross-section solid-state crystal is presented. The crystal is assumed to be longitudinally pumped by a Gaussian pump profile. The pump power attenuation along the crystal and the real cooling mechanisms, such as convection, are considered in detail. A comparison between our analytical solutions and its numerical counterparts shows excellent agreement when just a few terms are employed in the series solutions.}

  abstract={The presence of a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and the heat radiation boundary condition in the diffusion-type heat equation driven by a Gaussian source make it impossible to find an analytical solution for temperature distribution in the solid-state laser media. In this work, a temperature distribution for a solid-state end-pumped KTP (KTiOPO4) crystal under a Gaussian continuous wave as a heat source is reported. More precisely, the effects of considering the temperature-dependent nature of the thermal conductivity of the KTP crystal and the heat radiation from the end faces of the crystal, in addition to heat convection, which are usually ignored, were studied. It was shown that considering the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity leads to significantly different results compared to constant thermal conductivity case. In addition, it was shown that the radiation can be influential for crystals with large surfaces from which the radiation can occur. Making the crystal thinner, the radiation impact
becomes negligible and can be ignored.}

  abstract={In this work, a thorough and detailed solution for the time-dependent heat equation for a cylindrical nonlinear potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal under a repetitively pulsed pumping source is developed. The convection and radiation boundary conditions, which are usually ignored in the literature, have been taken into account, and their importance on the temperature distribution has been discussed in detail. Moreover, the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of KTP was considered in the calculations, and its impact is discussed. It is shown that the radiation term has a negligible effect and can be dropped safely, while the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is more influential, such that ignorance of it brings some errors into the modeling. The time evolution of the temperature while the crystal is pumping with a train of successive Gaussian pulses until reaching equilibrium is shown. To accomplish numerical calculations, we developed a homemade code written with the finite difference time domain method in Intel Fortran (ifort) and ran it with the Linux operating system.}

  abstract={Thermally induced phase mismatching (TIPM) has been proven to be an influential issue in nonlinear phenomena. It occurs when refractive indices of crystal are changed due to temperature rise. In this work, the authors report on a modeling of spatiotemporal dependence of TIPM in a repetitively pulsed pumping KTP crystal. Gaussian profiles for both spatial and temporal dependences of pump beam were used to generate second-harmonic waves in a type II configuration. This modeling is of importance in predicting the nonlinear conversion efficiency of crystals when heat is loaded in the system. To this end, at first, an approach to solve the heat equation in a repetitively pulsed pumping system with consideration of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity and realistic cooling mechanisms such as conduction, convection, and radiation, is presented. The TIPM is then calculated through the use of experimental thermal dispersion relations of KTP crystal. The results show how accumulative behaviors of temperature and TIPM (with its reverse sign) happen when the number of pulses is increased. Fluctuations accompanying temperature and TIPM were observed which were attributed to the offtime between successive pulses. Moreover, in this work, a numerical procedure for solving a repetitively pulsed pumped crystal is introduced. This procedure enables us to solve the problem with home-used computing machines.}

  abstract={In this work, the effect of temperature increase on the efficiency of a double-pass cavity type II second-harmonic generation (SHG) is investigated. To this end, a depleted wave model describing the continuous-wave SHG process with fundamental Gaussian waves was developed. First, six coupled equations were proposed to model a double-pass cavity to generate the second harmonic of a Gaussian fundamental wave in type II configuration. Then, the effect of temperature increase in the nonlinear crystal due to the optical absorption was modeled. To do this, a mismatched phase arising from changes in refractive indices was added to the coupled equations. Although the nondepleted assumption is usually used in such problems, a simultaneous solving of coupled equations with assumption of fundamental beam depletion was performed. The results were obtained by a homemade code written in Intel Fortran, and show how the efficiency of the SHG process decreases when the crystal is warmed up by 5, 10, and 15 K. Dramatic reductions inSHGefficiency were observed due to small changes in temperature. The results show excellent agreement with the experimental data [Opt. Commun. 173, 311–314 (2000)].}

  abstract={In this work, a three-dimensional and time-dependent nonlinear wave model to describe the generation of pulsed Bessel–Gauss second-harmonic waves (SHWs) is presented. Three coupled equations, two for ordinary and extraordinary fundamental waves and one for extraordinary SHWs, describing type II second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a KTiOPO_4 (KTP) crystal were solved by considering the depletion of fundamental waves (FWs). The results examined the validity of nondepleted wave approximation against the energy of pulses, beam spot size, and interaction length. It was shown that for pulses with spot sizes of ω_f=80  μm and energy of 0.8j, the nonlinear interaction was accomplished over a distance of ∼5  mm. Therefore, for KTP crystals with lengths longer than 5 mm, the nondepleted wave approximation can no longer be valid. To be valid, the crystal must be shorter than the interaction length, i.e., 5 mm.}

  abstract={A model describing the thermal effects in type II second harmonic generation (SHG) of Gaussian continuous-wave (CW) in a double-pass cavity is presented. The thermally induced phase mismatching (TIPM) along with thermal lensing was included in the classical SHG formalism through the interposing the heat and TIPM equations. To this end, eight equations were coupled together and solved simultaneously to reveal how the SHG is affected in time when heat is generated in the crystal. The model showed an excellent agreement with experimental data [Opt. Laser Tech.34, 333–336 (2002)]. Furthermore, a numerical procedure, which was developed in this work, is introduced for simultaneously solving the SHG, heat, and TIPM equations with home-used computing machines.}
